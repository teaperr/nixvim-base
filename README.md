# nixvim-base

A base nixvim config with home-manager.

I chose to commit this to a public repo for others to get a basic idea of how to set up nixvim easily. It took me a good few hours to finally get it working.

I have not tested this config being included as a flake locally yet.

There is a few directories and blank files made in home-manager/nvim for some of the most popular plugins along with a bash script to create them with different parameters if needed!
